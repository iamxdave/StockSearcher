# StockSearcher

Application was made to search stocks from the database and from an external API using Razor Pages, EntityFrameworkCore and Syncfusion models.

<br>
Application is the result of a project from my university and was made by myself without any further knowledge about Blazor.</a>.app</a>.

## How does it work

  Application creates a stock tickers database for all of the current companies and stores the instances for passing them to the application user.
  Application also creates individual accounts for all the users and allows them to save their searched stocks in the watchlist.
  
  Website redirect the user on start to the home page containing sideabar and a navbar with links to log in and to my Github profile.
